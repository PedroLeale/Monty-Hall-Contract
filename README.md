# Monty-Hall-Contract

This university assignment aims to implement a contract for the Monty Hall problem.
The ideia of the contract is to use a commit system to hide the bets and use tokens behind the "doors" of the Monty Hall problems to represent the "car" and the "goat".

At first the contract will only host one game, but it should later host multiple concorrent games.
At the start of each game, the main contract "MontyHall.sol" will randomize the tokens with different flags to fit the "car" or the "goat" representatives.
